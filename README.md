# Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ®

A simple, classic number guessing game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective is to guess a secret number chosen by the computer within a limited number of attempts.

This project demonstrates basic web development concepts including DOM manipulation, event handling, and simple game logic.

## Running Locally

If you want to run the game on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    # Replace YourUsername and YourRepositoryName with your actual details
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd YourRepositoryName
    ```
3.  **Open the `index.html` file** in your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the web page.
* **CSS3:** For styling the user interface.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For game logic, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

## Future Improvements (Ideas)

* Add difficulty levels (e.g., Easy: 1-25, Medium: 1-50, Hard: 1-100 with fewer guesses).
* Track high scores or fewest guesses using local storage.
* Improve UI/UX with better styling or animations.
* Add hints after a certain number of incorrect guesses.
